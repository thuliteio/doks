Effective announcements serve different reader needs:

- **Overview:** What’s new?
- **Context:** Why was this built?
- **Guidance:** How do I use it?
- **Details:** Where can I learn more?

By separating intent, explanation, and practical steps, you turn release posts into durable product documentation — not just temporary marketing updates.

Clear, structured announcements increase feature adoption, reinforce your product direction, and signal steady progress to both users and potential customers.
