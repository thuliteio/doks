Hi — I help build instruments that listen for the first echoes of the universe. Alongside that work, I’m devoted to making space where women and female-presenting folks in STEM can thrive — which isn’t about fitting in quietly, but about truth-telling, even (dare I say, especially) when that truth disrupts the room.

This site is a place where my research lives alongside the rest of me — reflections, projects, pursuits, and the ongoing story of how science, creativity, and personhood intertwine.
